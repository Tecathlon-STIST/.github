## Problem at hand
Within the automotive landscape of developing countries like India, a critical safety concern persists. While high-end vehicles are equipped with advanced automatic emergency braking technology, these solutions are financially out of reach for the majority of the population. Moreover, a substantial number of vehicles currently in use, regardless of their price range, lack this essential safety feature. In the midst of the tech industry's focus on autonomous solutions, existing vehicles often remain without adequate safety enhancements.

## AI solution
We propose the development of a compact hardware device engineered to enhance vehicle safety and connectivity, designed for seamless integration with a vehicle's On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) port. This device will continuously collect and transmit vital vehicle data, including speed, accelerator pedal position, and brake pedal position. Additionally, it will be equipped with a front-facing camera for real-time video capture.
The cornerstone of this device is its persistent AI model, which will operate continuously in the background. This AI model, utilizing inputs from the camera feed and current speed, will consistently predict the expected brake pedal position. These predictions will be in constant comparison with the actual brake pedal position obtained via the OBD port.
In the event of a substantial disparity between the predicted and actual brake pedal positions, the system will proactively alert the driver. This ongoing, real-time monitoring and early warning mechanism provide drivers with extended reaction time to potential hazards, significantly augmenting road safety and accident prevention.
By seamlessly blending advanced hardware innovation with cloud-connected AI capabilities, our solution strives to address the safety disparity in existing vehicles, offering accessible and continuous collision avoidance technology for drivers in developing regions.

## Potential Impact
The project envisions a significant impact on road safety, particularly in developing regions like India, where advanced automotive safety technologies often remain inaccessible to a vast portion of the population. The introduction of a compact hardware device, combined with an ever-operational AI model, holds promise in several key areas:
1. **Accident Prevention**: By providing early warnings to drivers in emergency situations, this solution has the potential to prevent a substantial number of accidents. The continuous monitoring and comparison of brake pedal positions can detect imminent collisions and allow drivers ample time to react.
2. **Improved Accessibility**: The affordability and ease of installation of the hardware device make it accessible to a broad spectrum of vehicle owners, including those who own older or budget-friendly vehicles. This democratization of safety technology can benefit millions.
3. **Reduced Casualties**: With a focus on accident prevention, the project aims to reduce the severity of road accidents and, subsequently, the number of casualties and injuries. This can lead to substantial improvements in public health and reduced healthcare burdens.
4. **Data-Driven Insights**: The device's ability to collect and transmit real-time vehicle data offers an opportunity for data-driven insights into driving habits, road conditions, and accident patterns. These insights can be used to further enhance road safety measures.

In summary, this project has the potential to revolutionize road safety in developing countries, offering an effective, affordable, and accessible solution that can save lives, reduce injuries, and positively impact both public health and the economy. It represents a significant step toward making roads safer for everyone.
